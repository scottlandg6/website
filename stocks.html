  <p> My shares were bought from 2/13/2013 - 3/15/2013, at prices from $11.75 - $12.04.  This following paragraph was written in December of 2013.
  I invested in Bank of America simply because it is one of the faces of American banking. Since around the time of the Greek Crisis in '11, where the stock market took a great hit, stocks in the financial sector have consistently been on the rise, mainly due to the improving world economy, and most importantly, the strengthening of the American economy. Bank of America has also been becoming more favorable in the public eye as it copes with many of the problems and debts it acquired during the economic crisis. I believe that this trend will continue, and Bank of America, which had all time highs of around $55 before the financial collapses of 2008, still has much room to grow. </p>

  <p> This ETF encompasses the major banks, and I believe it is an extremely strong choice right now. As I am optimistic of the current state of the economy, this investment, although volatile at times, will undoubtedly have an upward trend if the world markets and the U.S. markets grow, which over the past few years has constantly been happening. It has more than quintupled since I bought it in January of 2012 and is still going really strong. Buying and selling this stock during certain periods of economic growth and downturn will yield extremely good results.
  I am long FAS. </p>

  <p> Zynga is an interesting choice I made after much research; I acquired Zynga at around $2.70. When I first bought it, the main reason for my investment was because, although Zynga's social media games were slowly falling out of favor with the Facebook crowd, it was planning on entering the online gambling industry. However, a few months ago, that quickly fell apart.</p>
</p>
  <p>Written on 9/10/2013:</p>
    <p>There are several reasons as to why I believe Zynga is a risky stock with a great upside. For starters, its current stock price is sitting at around $3, with a market cap of $2.41B as of the end of September 11. From its initial IPO of $10, this stock hit all-time lows earlier this year due to lack of innovation and profitable products. Many analysts bash on this stock, and currently many recommend either to “hold” or “sell” it. On top of that, the last quarterly earnings report was a big flop; although it beat expectations, the prospects of the company were dropped.
    These are just some of the negative sentiments causing investors and analysts alike to severely look down upon this stock. However, this puts Zynga, interestingly, in a good position. The expectations for this stock are EXTREMELY low. Now, for the short run, this may not seem too great. However, it is noted that the company has a LOT of its market cap in cash and equivalents, even as much as $1.5B. In other words, it has plenty of money to perform Research and Operations for long term growth, and thus, has a lot of potential for growth the “low expectations” are not considering. It is simply that expectations are so low for this company, as can be seen by an earlier quarterly earnings report where, although they lost revenue, it was less than expected, and it shot up 10%, that I believe investors will be surprised when they do release any bit of good news. </p>

    <p>Earlier this year, Zynga largely severed ties with Facebook. I believe that this now gives Zynga much more room to grow. I, for one, believe that they were tied down by Facebook taking much of the profits from their games. Now that they have hits such as Zynga poker, Farmville, and others, I believe they are able to stand alone.
    I must also point to the recent CEO change. Zynga has now acquired Don Mattrick, who was previously the President of Interactive Entertainment at Microsoft – responsible for the Xbox 360, the Xbox Live, and others. As we know, this was an extremely successful line of products for the gaming aspect of Microsoft. Now that his talents are at Zynga, I believe that his guidance will help Zynga in a positive way many investors are not thinking of.
    Finally, I would like to point at the market cap. Currently at around the $2.41 billion dollar mark, this stock can actually be a great takeover target by another company seeking a mobile gaming aspect to its company.
    Many of these changes were recent and thus have not fully taken effect, and I am thus compelled to believe Zynga is currently an undervalued stock, with really low expectations, and its upside outweighs its downsides.</p>
  ~~~
  <p>Update 9/26/14: 
  Currently, I sold some of my shares at near peak but bought some back after it fell again. It peaked out at 4.50$ at one point but took a large hit recently due to woes about its looming earnings releases. 
  However, I am still keeping it because what it currently lacks is innovation. With the new CEO and other key members, Zynga, which still has a majority of its market cap in cash and liquidity, simply needs new hit titles to attract users, and as an undervalued stock, will soar if such happens. Zynga is currently working with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment to release a Looney Tunes game, as well as entering the sports games with Tiger Woods and an NFL game. At this point, its stock price is very near the market cap it holds in cash and liquidity, and thus, I still believe that it is an undervalued stock with higher upsides than downsides.

    <p> I have recently decided to invest in Facebook. At it's IPO, I did not feel like Facebook was a good investment option because of one main problem: its revenue. At that time, Facebook was simply a social networking site, overvalued by investors (which we saw in its plummet in stock price after IPO), that did not have a good business model nor a model to generate a profitable revenue. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      However, since then, Facebook has made great progress. They have been surpassing Wall Street expectations for the past few quarters and has successfully been able to tackle issues that web-based companies traditionally have a lot of problem with. Their membership and site traffic undoubtedly makes them the largest social networking site, and they successfully are able to monetize this traffic, with revenues exceeding $2 billion for a quarter. Their recent purchases of Instagram, Whatsapp, and Occulus Rift have highly impressed me. Although the $19 billion purchase of Whatsapp seems exorbitant, I believe the purchase was extremely smart in obtaining what is crucial to any site that runs off of the Facebook business model, users. WhatsApp, as of time of purchase, had over 450 million users (and now has over 600 million), is the most popular messaging app on smart phones, and caters to rapidly growing emerging markets of countries like India, Mexico, and Brazil, as well as the countries of Europe. This will bring Facebook much more ad revenue and an ever-growing user database. I particularly like the purchase of Occulus Rift by Facebook, as they take a gamble and enter the virtual reality industry, which is an extremely new industry with vibrant technology. Their partnership with Samsung recently, and Occulus being at the forefront of the VR competition sheds a very positive light on this acquisition. </p>
      <p> Overall, I believe that Facebook is an extremely strong company with much room to grow. I am long Facebook. </p>
